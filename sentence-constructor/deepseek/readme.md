# Deepseek

I tried both Deepseek models. Slightly different prompts worked for each. When I used the prompt in `deepseek_prompt.txt` it would give away the answer in the hints section. When I used the prompt in`deepseek_r1.prompt.txt` with the main deepseek model it would cause the vocabulary table to be repetitive.
